In our course Apply Machine Learning , We develop car price prediction models and compare them by accuracy. 

Firstly ,We collected data by using python.
Next, We did preprocessing data and saved in imputed_last_data_csv file. 
Then, we saved the data from the imputed_last_data_csv file and encoded data in the encoded_data_csv file.
Finally, We did model development and evaluation .
